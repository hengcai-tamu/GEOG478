## Course philosophy and goals

Geography 476 teaches hand-on skills for students to get started with developing web-based maps and GIS applications using free and open-source development platforms and software. This course introduces concepts and techniques of web design, digital cartography, and development of interactive web maps and web-based GIS apps. Students will learn a suite of web development languages and protocols including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Students will utilize open-source software, libraries and services (including QGIS, Leaflet, MapBox, and GeoServer) for web map development. The course combines lectures and lab exercises. Lectures introduce principles of web service architecture, spatial data models and management, digital cartography, and geospatial visual analytics. In lab exercises, students will practice to developing web maps for real-world applications. In-class demonstration will be provided to instruct students to use the various tools and services.

## Requirements:
Although programming skill is NOT a prerequisite, students are required to program using web scripting languages including HTML and JavaScript. Specific requirements of the course include:
- Prior experience in GIS and geospatial data. Completion of GEOG-388, 389, 489 or other GIS courses would satisfy this prerequisite.
- Being comfortable with working on a computer and proficient in using a Windows or macOS system.
- Prior programming experience is recommended. It will be helpful if you understand the basic programing constructs such as variables, functions, loops, if-else statement.

## Course materials
This course does not require any textbook. You will be required to complete readings of online materials assigned in class.

Example online materials include:

A laptop (either PC or Mac) is recommended for this course.

## Course lab work
Labs will be introduced in class and explanation will be given to accomplish the tasks.  Time will be allotted **in class** to work on the labs.  If more time is needed, they can be finished after class.  The labs will be **due one weeks later after lab is started.  Labs up to 1 week late are penalized 20%. Labs more than 1 week late are penalized 100%**.

Please note you may work together on labs, but you each must do every part of each lab, and **turn in entirely your own work**.  That means each of you should perform every step indicated in the lab manual. **Your grade is for individual effort; copied files/maps from other students will be construed as cheating, at a minimum you’ll get zero credit for the lab, and you may automatically fail the course.**

All labs will be done in computer. Students can choose to work on their own laptop or the lab computers. We will set up an account for every student in the computer lab.

Assignment submissions may include developed application, data and lab report. The method of submission will be indicated in lab instructions

## Exams
The mid-exam is a close-book exam for testing students’ acquisition of core knowledge in the course.

## Attendance and participation
The standard university guidelines apply, as you might imagine. However, I will repeat some of the essential “rules” for a successful course.  Be respectful to the instructor and fellow students.  Participation in class activities will be noted and will influence your final grade.  The following are never acceptable in class: chronic tardiness, talking out of turn, sleeping, reading non-class material, CELL PHONE USE, emailing or text messaging, and disruptive behavior.  You are responsible to make up missed information or work on your own time if absent or late.  Cheating of any type, on labs or exams will result in a zero for the work and a referral to appropriate school authorities.  This is a “learning through doing” course and you can only succeed through your own personal application.

***To that end, **unexcused absences of 5 or more will result in a failing grade for the course**.  You must communicate with your instructor if you know you will be absent.  Documentation for the absence may be required in order to be “excused.”

If you have any challenges to learning and need support of any kind, you are invited to contract your instructor or the Kokua Center for assistance or questions.
